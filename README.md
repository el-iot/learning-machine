<h1>Machine Learning From Scratch</h1>
A repository of Machine-learning models built "from scratch" with no usage of traditional ML-Libraries (beyond numpy for speed).

<h2> ConnectAI </h2>
A Neural-Network built from first-principles using numpy, trained to play Connect-4.

<h3>The Net</h3>
A simple neural network was built using *numpy* package. It has 84 input neurons, 6 neurons in its first hidden layer, 3 neurons in its second hidden layer and 1 output neuron currently, though this is likely to change.

<h3>The Data</h3>
The network was trained on the Connect-4 dataset available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connect-4).
